== Description ==

**WooCommerce Admin is no longer supported**

WooCommerce Admin is now part of [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugin/woocommerce)! To make sure your store continues to run smoothly, check that WooCommerce is up-to-date (at least version 6.5) and then disable the WooCommerce Admin plugin.

**New Reports for WooCommerce**

WooCommerce Admin has a host of new reports that are optimized for speed and have advanced filters that allow you to dive into data about your store:

- Revenue Report
- Orders Report
- Products Report
- Variations Report
- Categories Report
- Coupons Report
- Taxes Report
- Downloads Report
- Stock Report
- Customers Report


**Customizable Dashboard**

WooCommerce Admin also allows store owners to customize a new dashboard screen with “performance indicators” that correspond in importance to their store’s operation.

== Getting Started ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 5.4.0
* WooCommerce 5.7.0 or greater
* PHP version 7.0 or greater. PHP 7.4 or greater is recommended
* MySQL 5.6 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.1 or greater.

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option, as WordPress handles the file transfers and you don't need to leave your web browser. To perform an automatic install:
1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to: Plugins > Add New.
3. Enter “WooCommerce Admin” in the Search field, and view details about its point release, the rating and description.
4. Select “Install Now” when you’re ready.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress Codex contains instructions at [Manual Plugin Installation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Where can I report bugs or contribute to the project? =

Bugs should be reported in the [WooCommerce Admin GitHub repository](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/).
