Hello, I am codecanyon author and I've got a coupon code for $250 for your services.
	
I'd like to redesign my item's page graphics: https://codecanyon.net/item/web-20-directory-plugin-for-wordpress/6463373
	
This is the directory plugin for wordpress.
	
I'd like to redesign thumbnail image (JPEG or PNG 80x80px), preview image (590x300 JPEG) and other images on the page (or pack them in some images files).
	
1. thumbnail image - something simple, but professional, like this icon https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/684657/agenda_catalog_checklist_index_list_listing_schedule_icon#size=128 but more professional and good looking. With or without words "Web 2.0 Directory". With or without small wordpress icon in the corner https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/345397/wordpress_icon#size=128
	
2. preview image - with the same texts as it is now, and make, please, special attention to following highlights: PayPal, Google Maps, WPML, WooCommerce, YouTube, SEO. Probably would be better to make these highlights as logos as it is now.
	
3. link image to "Web 2.0 Google Maps" plugin - something simple with the name of that plugin as text.
	
4. other images - highlight these special directory plugin's features:
- responsive layout, text: Responsive Layout
- customizations, text: Customizations and Predefined Color Schemas
- woocommerce with its logo, text: Payments System Compatible + Listings Packages
- search, text: Powerful and Customizable Search  <smaller>Search by categories, by locations, by zip, by keywords, by content fields + advanced search tab</smaller>
- listings levels, text: Frontend Submission and Users Dashboard  <smaller>Restrict ads by listings levels. Each level has own set of options and price</smaller>
- google maps, text: Google Maps and Markers Icons
- categories, text: Categories and Locations structures + Custom Icons
- paypal (probably just a logo) or with text: Compatible with PayPal
- stripe (probably just a logo) or with text: Compatible with Stripe
- wpml (probably just a logo) or with text: Compatible with WPML
- visual composer, logo and text: Compatible with Visual Composer
	
5. also we need to highlight following features of the plugin:
- Multiple Directories
- Five Star Ratings
- Compatible with Yoast SEO plugin
- Integration with Contact Form 7 plugin
- Claim Listings
- Upgrade and Downgrade Listings
- Raise Up Listings
- Renew Expired Listings
- Bulk CSV Import, Re-Import and Export
- YouTube Videos
- Bookmarks
- Print Listings
- Export Listings in PDF
- Powerful System of Shortcodes and Widgets
- Excellent Documentation and Support
	
I hope not so much items here. In your portfolio I saw you can group such items in one good looking image.
	
All images must have same styles, fonts, colors, e.t.c.
Use brands and logos where it is possible. But I'm not sure to use or not to use screenshots from our demo: http://www.salephpscripts.com/wordpress_directory/demo/ how do you think?
