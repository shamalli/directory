The aim of the Academy has always been to provide a thorough education and training. Pupils are nurtured by a staff of enthusiastic professional experts. Through the mixture of performance work, class and workshop study, along with individual tuition, we aim to provide all our students with the comprehensive package to equip them for working in the broader theatre industry. The Academy works to the principle that its students are aware of most jobs that are available in a working theatre and are familiar with the many opportunities available.
The course is designed to follow the programme similar to that of Drama Schools to establish the self discipline required for the theatre. Students are treated as individuals and helped with any concerns that may arise.
The Alicia Bardsley Singers consists of a Youth Choir ages ranging from 5 Years to 16 Years and SATB Ensemble group.
The choir has been very successful in competitions: quarter finalists in Sainsbury’s Choir of the year 1988, semi finalists in the National Choral Competition 1989, winners of Outstanding Performance Award in the National Festival for Youth 1989 in the Royal Festival Hall. Performers in the last night of the school proms in the Royal Albert Hall and also performers in the Northern School Proms in Bradford.

All of our Instructors at Bushido share our passion for the Art of Ju-Jitsu and have benefited from all it offers. As a team of dedicated and enthusiastic people we are keen to pass on these benefits to people of all ages to help them realise their own potential and strengths, improve their confidence, self-esteem, discipline, concentration, fitness, self-defence skills and through strong values helping them to become the people they wish to be. This is delivered through quality instruction, organisation, knowledge and understanding.
Our Instructors work with each student to ensure that they are progressing to the best of their ability as Ju-Jitsu offers the flexibility to suit each individuals needs. What makes us unique is our approach to teaching.
We consider our ‘club spirit’ and ‘sense of community’ to be paramount as students wish to enjoy the experience of learning an ancient art, disciplined but not regimented. Therefore our classes have a slightly more relaxed feel allowing students to enjoy interacting with each other whilst achieving realistic goals through physical, mental and spiritual growth.
